## Dataset Column
- Countries: Country of study.

Please note that in this dataset we calculate this indicator only by calculating GDP per capita! Despite the fact that the United Nations (UN) does not have an unambiguous classification of countries into developed, developing and backward based on only one indicator, such as the amount of GDP per capita. It uses a wider range of economic, social and quality indicators to determine the level of development of countries.

- Average_CDR: Average crude mortality rate for 2019â€“2021 in the country under study.
